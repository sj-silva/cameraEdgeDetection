### **Camera Edge Detection Web App**

This project is a **real-time video edge detection web application** that leverages **OpenCV.js** for edge detection processing directly in the browser. Users can access their webcam, process video frames, and visualize the edges of objects using the **Canny Edge Detection** algorithm. The app is designed to be interactive, allowing users to adjust the **low and high thresholds** via sliders to fine-tune the edge detection sensitivity. 

#### **Key Features**
- Real-time webcam integration and edge detection.
- Adjustable sliders for threshold values.
- Optimized performance using OpenCV's powerful image processing tools.
- Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive UI.

This tool is a lightweight demonstration of browser-based computer vision capabilities and showcases the potential of WebAssembly-powered libraries like OpenCV.js.

#### **How to Use**
You can test the app directly on its website: [Camera Edge Detection Web App](https://sj-silva.github.io/cameraEdgeDetection/).  
Make sure to **allow camera access** when prompted, as the app requires permission to access your webcam for real-time video processing.

#### **Example Case**

Below is an example of the Camera Edge Detection Web App in action. The GIF demonstrates how the app processes real-time video from the webcam and applies the Canny Edge Detection algorithm. You can observe the dynamic adjustment of thresholds to refine edge detection results.
